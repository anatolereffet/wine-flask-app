# ML Production
Project to deploy a trained model to production via an API.  
This project was made within Jedha Data Fullstack training

## Description
The purpose of this project is to deploy an ML model that predicts white wine quality using some inputs parameters. We have as input `winequality.csv` and `model/model.joblib`. 

## Workflow
To go on this project, we follow this workflow :
```workflow
Create project folder
Init git repository
Create virtual environnments
Retrained model (optional)
Create flask api endpoint to predict white wine quality score
Write documentation (flask restx)
Deploy on heroku
Set CI Github-Heroku
```

## Tools
